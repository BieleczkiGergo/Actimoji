= Technical Models

This chapter provides a detailed technical insight into the backend system of the Actimoji project. The backend is developed in Java using the Spring Boot framework and follows a modular, layered architecture.

== 1. System Architecture Overview

The backend application follows a layered architecture:

- **Controller layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Service layer**: Contains business logic.
- **Repository layer**: Interfaces with the database using Spring Data JPA.
- **Domain/Model layer**: Defines data structures and relationships.

The application also uses **WebSocket** for real-time communication in the game, and RESTful APIs for standard HTTP interactions.

== 2. Package Structure

The project is organized under the base package: `hu.actimoji`. Each feature is implemented in its own subpackage:

- `account`: User accounts, authentication, registration.
- `emoji`: Emoji parsing and storage.
- `game`: Game logic and state management.
- `moderatorRequest`: Handling user requests for moderator actions.
- `player`: Player-related models and logic.
- `review`: Word review process.
- `room`: Game room creation, joining, and management.
- `security`: Web security configuration.
- `suggestion`: User word suggestion logic.
- `word`: Word entities and retrieval logic.

== 3. Entity Models

Each entity is a Java class annotated with `@Entity` and is typically stored in its respective module.

Example: `Account` entity in `account/Account.java`:
[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Account {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String username;
    private String email;
    private String password;
    // ... getters, setters
}
----

All entities use JPA annotations, and most are linked via `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne` or `@OneToOne` relations.

== 4. Database

- Uses **MariaDB** as the database engine.
- ORM provided via Spring Data JPA.
- Each repository interface extends `JpaRepository`.
- Schema is auto-generated based on entities (DDL auto).

== 5. Services

Each module has a `Service` class (e.g., `AccountService`, `EmojiService`) containing business logic.

[source,java]
----
@Service
public class AccountService {
    public Account register(AccountDTO dto) {
        if (accountRepository.existsByEmail(dto.getEmail())) {
            throw new ExistingAccountException();
        }
        // Save logic
    }
}
----

== 6. REST API Endpoints

Controllers handle HTTP endpoints. Example from `AccountController`:

- `POST /account/register`
- `GET /account/{id}`

All endpoints return JSON and use `@RestController` annotation.

== 7. WebSocket Communication

Real-time game interaction uses WebSocket. Configuration class:

- `WebSocketConfig.java` â€“ Registers endpoint `/ws/game`.

Messages handled in `GameHandler.java`:
- Player joins
- Game state updates
- New word submissions

== 8. Exception Handling

Custom exceptions are defined, e.g., `AccountNotFoundException`, `ExistingAccountException`.

They are handled in `@ControllerAdvice` classes like `AccountExceptionHandler`.

== 9. Security

- Basic CORS configuration in `CorsConfig.java`.
- Authentication logic is currently minimal; future improvements possible.

== 10. Configuration

- `application.properties` defines DB config.
- Spring Boot auto-configures most components.

== 11. Dependencies

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, WebSocket
- MariaDB Connector
- Lombok

== 12. Build Tool

- Uses Maven (`pom.xml`)
- Includes plugin configurations for build and dependency management

== Summary

The backend is cleanly modularized and extensible. Real-time support, REST APIs, and database integration make it a robust architecture for a multiplayer word game.
